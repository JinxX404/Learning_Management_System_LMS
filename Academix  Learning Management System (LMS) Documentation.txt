1. Project Planning & Management
  1.1Project Proposal  
Overview
      The LMS Project is a comprehensive Learning Management and Student Information System (LMS/SIS) designed as a digital solution for universities and educational institutions to manage their academic environments efficiently. It unifies learning, administration, and communication in one platform for students, instructors, and administrators.
Students can access materials, track progress, and receive AI-generated quizzes and personalized support. Instructors can create and manage courses, upload content, assess students, and communicate through an intuitive dashboard. Administrators oversee user management, academic data, reporting, and system operations.
Equipped with AI-powered tools like a quiz generator and course-scoped assistant, the system enhances learning quality, automates repetitive tasks, and supports personalized education. Built for scalability, security, and usability, the LMS empowers universities to streamline processes, improve engagement, and provide accessible, data-driven learning experiences for all users anytime and anywhere.

Objectives:  
* Facilitate access to education anytime and anywhere.
* Organize course management with tools to create, edit, and delete content.
* Enable students to track progress, take assessments.
* Support instructors with tools to upload content, monitor learners, and provide feedback.
* Strengthen administration through reports and role-based access control.
* Enhance user experience with intuitive UI/UX design.
* Ensure security and reliability with safe login and data backups.

2. Literature Review
2.1  Feedback & Evaluation 
      -The relationship between the quizzes table and the courses table is not accurate
      -No table shows any information about semesters 
      -We made a separate table for roles 
      -There wasn’t a table containing the formats of notifications
      
2.2 Suggested Improvements:
-Modify the relationship between the quizzes table and the courses table
-Make a table and name it “Academic Terms” to show the details of the semester
-Involve roles in the users table, not in a separate table
-Make a table for Notifications templates 
-Add attribute to the student profile table that shows the admission date

4. System Analysis & Design

4.1  Problem Statement & Objectives
Problem Statement:
Educational institutions often struggle with managing online learning processes in a centralized and secure manner. The core problem is the lack of a unified system that allows instructors to publish content and manage assessments, enables students to access learning materials and track their progress, and provides administrators with full control over users and reporting. Existing solutions either complicate the process or inadequately meet the fundamental requirements.
Objectives:
* To provide a unified and easy-to-use e-learning platform.
* To enable instructors to create and manage course content and assessments.
* To enable students to access courses, track their academic progress, and obtain certificates.
4.2  Use Case Diagram & Descriptions
Actors:
& Student: Can view courses, take courses, view lessons, submit assignments, take quizzes, view grades, update profile.
& Instructor: Can create and manage courses, manage lessons and content, create and manage quizzes and assignments, grade student submissions, post announcements.
& Administrator: Can manage all users (create, update, delete), manage all courses, define academic terms, generate system-wide reports, manage system settings.

4.3  Sample Use Case Descriptions:
Use Case: Enroll in a Course
Actor: Student
Description: A student views the available courses for the current academic term and selects one to enroll in.
Use Case: Grade an Assignment
Actor: Instructor
Description: An instructor views a list of submitted assignments for their course, selects one, assigns a grade, and provides feedback.






Software Architecture:
Architecture Style: The system will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This separates the application's data model, user interface, and control logic, promoting organized code, easier maintenance, and parallel development.
High-Level Design:
& Presentation Layer (View): Comprises HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap pages. This layer handles user interaction and displays data received from the server.
& Application Layer (Controller): Built using C# with ASP.NET Core. This layer processes HTTP requests, contains the business logic, interacts with the data layer, and sends responses back to the presentation layer.
& Data Layer (Model): Consists of a Microsoft SQL Server database. This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving all system data, including user information, courses, grades, and announcements.

The system also includes a Light and Dark Mode palette for user comfort in different lighting environments.
Typography:
Primary Font: "Inter", sans-serif — chosen for its modern, clean appearance and readability across screen sizes.
Font Hierarchy: Headings range from 24–32px, while body text uses 16px for readability.

Accessibility: 
Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable. Provide sufficient color contrast (minimum WCAG AA standard). Use alt text for all informative images.

4.8 Additional Deliverables

4.8.1  API Documentation
After Web API is developed, documentation will be provided using Swagger/OpenAPI.
Example Endpoint: POST /api/assignments/{id}/submit
Description: Submits an assignment for a student. Parameters: Assignment ID, Student ID, Submission File. Response: Success confirmation or error message.


4.8.2  Testing & Validation
Unit Testing: xUnit or NUnit for testing individual backend methods (e.g., grade calculation logic).
Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between the frontend, backend API, and database.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan: A set of test scenarios will be given to a select group of students, instructors, and administrators to ensure the system meets their needs before final deployment.
4.8.3  Deployment Strategy
Hosting Environment: A cloud platform such as Microsoft Azure. The web app will be hosted on Azure App Services, and the database on Azure SQL Database.
Deployment Pipelines: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). Automate build and deployment processes upon pushing code to the main branch.
Scaling Considerations: Azure App Services and Azure SQL Database can be scaled vertically (more powerful resources) and horizontally (more instances) based on user load
5. Implementation (Source Code & Execution)
5.1  Source Code
